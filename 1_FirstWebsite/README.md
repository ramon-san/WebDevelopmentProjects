# First Website

> Code of a very basic website (that isn't published) that I did along side a web development course.

*Generic:* This code is not meant to be an actual website, it was made for didactical reasons and it uses Bootstrap as a CSS Framework to develop a—maybe not so—nice looking design. The purpose of this code is to consolidate all the things I´ve been shown in the course so far.

*Specific:* The concept of this website is fundamental particles, so besides being a coding project this also contains a brief research into this subatomic building blocks of the universe. Hope you like it!

### Technical details

There aren't alot of technical details:
- Bootstrap version 4.3.1
- Google Font Roboto
