# Web Development Projects

A few web development projects I did during [Colt Stelee's Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-web-developer-bootcamp/){:target="_blank"}.

The folder contains the following proyects:

1. FirstWebsite
2. ScoreKeeper
3. LanguageGuesser
4. TweetGenerator

Each folder contains its own README.md file that explains what it does and gives any needed instructions.
