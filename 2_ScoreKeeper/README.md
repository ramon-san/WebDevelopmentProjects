# Score Keeper

> Code of a very basic website (that isn't published) that I did along side a web development course.

*Generic:* This code is not meant to be an actual website, it was made for didactical reasons and it uses Bootstrap as a CSS Framework to develop a—maybe not so—nice looking design. The purpose of this code is to consolidate all the things I´ve been shown in the course so far.

*Specific:* The concept of this website is a basic score keeper in which you're interaction with buttons is processed by JavaScript. It is a simple program, but complexity was not the aim in this assignment.

### Technical details

There aren't alot of technical details:
- Bootstrap version 4.3.1
